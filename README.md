# Spot-The-Difference

This is an interactive "Spot the Difference" game built using React, where players are shown two side-by-side images and must click on visual differences between them.

## Key Functionalities:
1) Dynamic JSON Configuration:
Game content (image paths and difference coordinates) is fully controlled through an external JSON file. Updating levels only requires modifying this file.

2) Interactive Gameplay:
Players click on areas where they spot differences. Correct clicks are highlighted with circles, while incorrect ones show red markers.

3) Real-Time Score Tracking:
The number of found differences is tracked and displayed live.

4) Level Progression:
After completing a level, players can retry or proceed to the next level using provided buttons.

5) Timer Feature:
A timer displays how long a player takes to complete each level.

6) Sound Effects:
Correct and incorrect clicks trigger different sound effects for enhanced feedback (click sound removed as per user preference).

7) Responsive Design:
Optimized for both desktop and mobile play.
